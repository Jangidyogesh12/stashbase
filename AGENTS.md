# Working on StashBase

## Product Context

StashBase is an **IDE for writing** in ordinary local projects. The main flow is:
enter a project → brainstorm with an agent → draft and revise → refine.
An empty project is valid; references, search, and wiki building are optional.

- **Documents mode** is a VSCode-like files/editor workspace.
- **Chat mode** is a Claude/ChatGPT-like conversation workspace.
- Both share the project and preserve unfinished work. A folder is a project
  scope and search namespace; the product has no global Library.

Local file handling, preparation, indexing, retrieval, and agent-assisted writing
are implemented, including inline prose revision. Existing file diffs and
save-conflict comparisons are separate. Defects and missing evidence are not
additional planned features.

Search UI says **By keyword / By meaning**; grep/hybrid are implementation strategies.

## Documentation Map

Use this map to find an answer, then the task routes below to choose what to read.
These documents are references, not a checklist to read in full for every task.

| Document | Question it answers |
|---|---|
| [README.md](README.md) | What is StashBase, and how do I get started? The short external introduction. |
| [Design Docs](design-docs/README.md) | What should the product do? Routes to product identity, terminology, vertical journeys, horizontal capabilities, and visual intent. Planned behavior stays in its owning design. |
| [Review Guide](code-review/README.md) | How should I scope a review, inspect a change, and report findings? |
| [Engineering Boundaries](code-review/architecture.md) | Which module or process owns a responsibility, and what rules must changes preserve? |
| [Journey Coverage](code-review/journey-coverage.md) | Which code implements a user journey, what evidence exists, and what remains unproven or broken? |
| [Release Runbook](code-review/release-pipeline.md) | How are source CI, packaging, signing, release verification, and publication performed? |
| [MAINTENANCE.md](MAINTENANCE.md) | Who maintains each kind of document, when should it change, and how are status and compatibility decisions recorded? |
| [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) | How do I set up development and run focused or complete checks? |
| [User/operator guides](docs/) | How does a user or operator use and troubleshoot the product? |
| [Release checklists](release-checklists/) | What still needs checking in the packaged application? |

`CLAUDE.md` points to this file; `CONTEXT.md` points to the
[Glossary](design-docs/glossary.md). They do not define separate policies.

## Choose the Review Route

Read only the affected sections, then inspect the implementation and tests.
Respect the requested scope, including whether frontend UI is excluded.

| Task | Starting point and route |
|---|---|
| Discuss a design or feature | Product overview → [user journey](design-docs/journeys/README.md) → [shared capability](design-docs/README.md#horizontal-designs-capabilities) → engineering boundary → current code. Separate an agreed requirement from a proposed change. |
| Review a user journey | Select its Jxx section in [Journey Coverage](code-review/journey-coverage.md). Follow its renderer and host/service entries through the operation, failure, cancellation, and recovery paths. Read the linked product intent and boundaries. |
| Review a branch, commit, PR, or working tree | Pin the comparison point; include relevant uncommitted/new files. Follow the [diff-first route](code-review/README.md#diff-first-review), expanding through callers and crossed boundaries. |
| Diagnose or fix a bug | Find the affected journey/boundary, reproduce the failure, and trace its state owner. Verify the fix at the lowest useful layer and through the affected runtime flow when needed. |
| Measure or improve performance | Run the matching scenario in [scripts/profiling](scripts/profiling/README.md) before and after the change, and report the compared ranges. Add a scenario when none covers the task. |
| Simplify code or audit shared infrastructure | Start from [Engineering Boundaries](code-review/architecture.md). Trace real callers and the purpose they serve; absence from a journey map alone is not proof of dead code. |

## Vertical and Horizontal Review

- **Vertical — follow a user task.** Start with its Jxx journey and follow the
  entry through success, failure, cancellation, and recovery. Use Journey
  Coverage to find code and evidence, then identify the shared capabilities it uses.
- **Horizontal — compare the callers of a capability.** Start with its design
  and engineering owner. Trace real UI, agent, MCP, and background callers as
  applicable; compare identity, state, permissions, errors, and recovery. Look
  for duplicate rules and bypasses, while preserving intentional differences.
- **Use both when a change affects shared state or multiple entries.** Check
  the shared rule once at its owner, then the distinct risks at each affected
  entry. A local change does not require an audit of every journey.

Do not infer a unified implementation from a unified design. Identify current
owners in code; report consolidation opportunities separately from defects.
See the [review method](code-review/README.md#horizontal-review) for tracing details.

## Review Principles

- **Necessity:** connect code to a current user task or required infrastructure.
  For whole-product audits, follow the [necessity review](code-review/README.md#necessity-review):
  a caller, test, or old design paragraph alone does not justify retaining a feature.
  Question assumptions inherited from the former knowledge-base/global-Library
  model; optional wiki work must not become a prerequisite for writing.
- **Simplicity:** prefer one owner for each rule, state, and operation. Remove
  unused paths, duplicate logic, and unnecessary abstractions after checking
  callers. Do not preserve complexity merely because it already exists.
- **Correctness:** trace project scope, permissions, source versions, concurrent
  work, cancellation, disposal, and recovery. Failures must not broaden access,
  overwrite newer work, or silently report success.
- **Evidence:** code establishes current behavior; product docs establish intent.
  When they differ, record the mismatch. Tests prove only exercised paths;
  controlled fixtures do not establish real-provider quality or packaged behavior.
- **Compatibility:** remove historical-data-only migration/repair code under the
  [previous-version data policy](MAINTENANCE.md#previous-version-data-policy).
  Keep current validation, persistence, rollback, and crash recovery. User files
  and active external protocols are separate concerns.

Report findings with a code location, consequence, and supporting or missing
evidence. Distinguish defects from product proposals and maintenance judgments.
State what was reviewed, validated, and left unproven; do not equate a green
command or a complete map with a complete review.

## Documentation and Implementation

Before writing code, read the affected journey, shared capability, and engineering boundary.
Update them in the same change when behavior or constraints change; update the
Jxx entry when code ownership, evidence, or gaps change. Preserve stable journey IDs.

Keep each topic with its owner: product behavior in Design Docs, cross-module
rules in Engineering Boundaries, local rationale beside code, exact checks in
configuration, and assertions in tests. Keep the four-document review structure;
do not create a document for every module or retain completed research as a
second specification. All committed docs are English-only.

The renderer under `renderer/` is the frontend. Read
[the renderer boundary](code-review/architecture.md#renderer-boundaries) before
changing anything under `renderer/src`. Daily validation follows the core-flow
policy below. `pnpm check:web` remains the complete renderer audit used by CI,
not a requirement for every local UI change. Exact rules live in its configurations.

## GitHub access for this repository

For GitHub write operations on `liliu-z/stashbase` (including PR/issue
comments, reviews, merges, and workflow dispatches), use the locally
authenticated `gh` CLI directly. The GitHub Connector is authenticated as a
different account and does not have write access to this repository, so do not
probe a Connector write first. Connector reads remain available when useful.

## Temporary worktrees

Secondary Git worktrees do not inherit ignored local dependencies. Before
running Electron journeys that exercise indexing or sync, make sure the
worktree has `python/.venv.nosync`: reuse a working primary checkout's venv via
an explicit symlink when appropriate, or run `pnpm setup:python`. Without it,
`/api/index-status` and `/api/sync` return misleading 500 responses with
`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mfs'`; treat that as worktree setup, not
as a product regression. Never commit the venv or its symlink.

## Electron launch environment

The agent host may inherit `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`. Remove it from the child
environment before any command that must launch Electron as a desktop runtime,
including Electron smoke tests and temporary visual harnesses.
On POSIX, run commands as
`env -u ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE pnpm test:electron:smoke` (and apply the same
prefix to the other Electron launch command). If `require('electron').app` is
undefined or a smoke fails at `app.setPath`, treat the inherited variable as
environment setup, not a product regression. Do not remove the variable from
flows that intentionally run Electron's embedded Node runtime.

## Development loop

When the user reports a bug or asks for a feature, run the full loop:

1. Locate and diagnose after reading the relevant design and engineering boundary sections.
2. Implement while preserving these cross-cutting constraints: sync and
   conversion are folder-explicit; hidden derived notes never surface; one
   daemon owns the local index; credentials live only in Settings, never env.
3. During implementation, run the smallest check that exercises the changed
   user outcome. At completion, run the core gate once plus affected checks;
   do not run the full repository audit after each fix.
4. Update affected docs in the same change. Run `pnpm test:docs` for changes to
   the documentation structure, links, contracts, or journey mapping as part
   of the pre-commit gate.
5. Leave work uncommitted until the user asks to commit.

## Test Selection

The primary acceptance flow is J01: open an empty folder, prepare the chosen
Agent, sign in, receive a completed first reply, update a native runtime when
needed, and return without repeating login. Exercise Default, Claude, Codex,
and Antigravity. Ready alone is not acceptance of a conversation.
Prioritize genuinely uninstalled/signed-out environments and broken existing
installations. Reusing a developer's established login is returning-user
evidence only. Follow the small environment matrix in the command guide;
separate real OS/provider verification from controlled fixture coverage.

Prefer extending that flow over adding a regression file for each small bug.
Keep focused tests for consequential risks the flow cannot reliably prove:
lost drafts/files, source conflicts, project isolation, permissions,
cancellation, and duplicate sends. Do not repeat constants, file lists, trivial
forwarding, or existing Story assertions. Remove duplicate proof when consolidating;
keep one primary owner for each rule.

`pnpm check` is the default local gate: types, core onboarding composition,
host setup/source-preservation checks and the controlled bundled runtime.
Other features use [focused checks](CONTRIBUTING.md#testing) when affected.
`pnpm check:all` is the full source audit for CI parity or broad infrastructure
changes, not the routine response to every small bug. A completed aggregate
satisfies its constituent checks; do not rerun them without new changes or a
failure. Build once and reuse those outputs within the validation run.

Automated checks and ordinary visual/profiling runs use isolated Agent
discovery and cannot launch the developer's installed CLIs. Real-provider
onboarding uses the explicit persistent profile in the command guide. Reuse
login for daily first-reply checks; exercise fresh login/install when those
paths change or during release acceptance. Controlled ports and gateways do
not prove OAuth or provider availability. Record those gaps in J01.

## Pre-commit verification

Before creating commits, run `pnpm check` once and the focused checks for changed
boundaries. Documentation/link changes add `pnpm test:docs`; renderer changes
add formatting/lint and affected behavior tests. Changes to renderer architecture
or the toolchain add `pnpm check:web`. Electron/process changes add focused
Electron checks and built-output smoke after a fresh build. Do not add coverage,
the entire Story catalog and both builds to every local UI fix. CI retains the
complete source matrix.

Review changed visible composition in the running app or the relevant Story.
Installation/login/update/session transport changes also require the matching
real-provider onboarding pass, with uncompleted external steps recorded as gaps.
An unavailable account is not a passing login check. No pixel-baseline suite
is required.

## Commit protocol

When the user asks to commit, group the dirty tree into focused commits by
theme—feature, fix, refactor, docs—without unrelated work. Match existing
subjects: `fix(scope): …`, `feat(scope): …`, `refactor(scope): …`,
`docs(scope): …`, `chore: …`. Split mixed-file hunks when needed so each
commit stands on its own. Do not push unless the user says push or asks for a
release.

## Release trigger

When the user asks to release or package a build, read and follow
[`code-review/release-pipeline.md`](code-review/release-pipeline.md) in full.
The only question is the patch/minor/major version choice; everything after it
runs unattended. Tidy focused commits, make the version bump the final commit,
and push `main` once. Successful exact-commit source CI triggers tagging and publication; do not
create a second release branch. Then verify all platform assets plus residual
packaged UI sanity.

Packaging is release-only. `pnpm dist:brew` is a local macOS fallback, not the
default. Never commit packaged artifacts; outputs belong in `release.nosync/`.
