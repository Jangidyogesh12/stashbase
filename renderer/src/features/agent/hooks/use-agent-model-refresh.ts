/**
 * A fresh hosted model list, fetched from the turn the old one was refused on.
 *
 * The Default Agent reads its approved models when its session starts, and
 * every turn names the configuration it was shown. When the service changes
 * that configuration, the turn is refused; reconnecting starts a session that
 * reads the list again. Nothing is sent again here: the reader reviews the
 * model first, and only then may send the same request from the failed turn.
 * The conversation, the draft, and any paused queue stay as they were.
