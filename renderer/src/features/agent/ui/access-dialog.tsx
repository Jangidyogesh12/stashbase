/** The first-send access gate: one question, the action that answers it, and
 *  the way out.
 *
 *  The question is about the Agent this chat is already on, so the panel
 *  offers that one action rather than a menu of runtimes. Bringing your own
 *  Codex or Claude stays a choice in the composer's picker and a setup
 *  step in Settings, which owns runtimes; a gate that listed them too turned
 *  one decision into three and made every one of them look equally likely.
 *
 *  It is not `ConfirmDialog`, which holds its panel open while the action
 *  runs. This action waits on a browser that may never come back, so Not now
 *  and Close stay live the whole time: they retire the retained send. Stop
 *  waiting ends only the browser wait, and the send stays for the next answer.
 *
 *  Connecting a native runtime can take minutes: a download, an installer,
 *  and the provider's sign-in in the browser. While it runs, the panel says
 *  which step the service is on and how long the wait has lasted, so a slow
 *  step never reads as a stuck one.
 *
 *  The Default Agent's answer is the account's own sign-in dialog, which this
 *  panel hands over to rather than sitting beneath; it shows again only with
 *  the reason the sign-in did not finish. */
