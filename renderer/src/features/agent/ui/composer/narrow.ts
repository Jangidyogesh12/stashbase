/** How the composer's controls give ground as the pane narrows. The composer
 *  card is the `@container`, so these read the pane rather than the window.
 *
 *  At the narrow step the words a reader can do without go: the provider's
 *  name, the mode's name, the persona's name, and Default's Tools label.
 *  The model-and-thinking control keeps its model and level, which the
 *  folded triggers beside it leave room for. At the narrowest step those go
 *  too and every trigger is an icon; a hover tooltip still names each
 *  trigger's selection. */
