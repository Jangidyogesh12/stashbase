/** The `GET /api/index-status` response contract.

 *  This is the folder-scoped status the sidebar, search banner, and preview
 *  banners poll. It is a superset of the indexer's own status
 *  (`IndexerStatus` in `server/indexer.ts`): the route re-derives the path
 *  lists as folder-relative visible paths and folds in embedding
 *  availability, conversion scheduling, and preparation failures.
 *
 *  The schema in `protocols/http/index-status.ts` is the single source of
 *  truth; these types are what `buildIndexStatus` in `server/index-status.ts`
 *  produces. Types only — no runtime, no Node imports.
